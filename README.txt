Are you passionate about...

Disruption?

Changing the game?

Recognizing the feelings of others?

Feeling valued?

Working in lean, agile teams?

Workgroups with a purpose?

Acceptance?

Diversity of thought, identity, and experience?

Honest and open cultures?

Telling it like it is and addressing elephants in the room? Acknowledging mistakes?

Volunteering?

Neurodiversity?

Access to care? Healthy medication?

Simple confidentiality?

Psychological safety? 

Emotional intelligence? 

Standing on the shoulders of giants?

Do you have a lot of ideas? Where's your spark?

Talk to a Veteran you can Trust
They need someone to talk to, someone who understands, someone they can trust. When they call our Lifeline for Vets‚Ñ¢ - 888-777-4443 - they reach another veteran of America‚Äôs armed forces. Speaking to another Veteran who ‚Äúgets it‚Äù is crucial for a soldier who has returned to the homeland he or she has defended only to feel like ‚Äúa stranger in a strange land‚Äù ‚Äì full of fear, wracked with depression and on the verge of despair.
